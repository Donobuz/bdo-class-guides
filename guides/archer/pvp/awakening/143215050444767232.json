  "largeScaleRole": "In large scale PvP (Node Wars, Siege, Red Battlefield), Archer excels as a backline damage dealer. Focus on picking off isolated targets and applying pressure from maximum range. Coordinate with your guild to focus fire on priority targets. Use your mobility to reposition quickly when enemies push your lines.",
